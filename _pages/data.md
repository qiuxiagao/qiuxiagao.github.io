## I. Pollution Data

### 1. Global Satellite PM2.5 Data  
- **Coverage**: Global  
- **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly  
- **Spatial Resolution**: 0.01° × 0.01° grid  
- **Time Period**: 2000–2023  
- **Description**: Provided by [Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group]([https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1516771113](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/)). PM₂.₅ concentrations estimated using satellite remote sensing (MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS), chemical transport models, and ground-based observations.

### 2. Satellite SO2 Data  
- **Coverage**: Global  
- **Temporal Resolution**: Daily  
- **Spatial Resolution**: 0.25° × 0.25° grid  
- **Time Period**: 2004–present  
- **Description**: NASA OMI (OMSO2e) Dataset. Column-level SO₂ concentration retrieved from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite, useful for monitoring point sources like power plants and volcanic emissions.

### 3. India Air Quality Monitor Data  
- **Coverage**: India (state and city level)  
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly / Real-time  
- **Time Period**: 2013–present  
- **Description**: Collected from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Ground-monitoring station data covering major pollutants such as PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂, SO₂, and CO. Useful for evaluating policy interventions such as NCAP and studying health/environmental outcomes.

## II. Power and Steel Plant Data

### 1. Global Power Plant Data  
- **Coverage**: Global  
- **Plant Types**: Coal, Gas, Hydro, Wind, Solar, Nuclear, Biomass, etc.  
- **Attributes**:  
  - Geographic location (latitude & longitude)  
  - Installed capacity (MW)  
  - Fuel type and technology  
  - Ownership and operating company  
  - Commissioning (start) and retirement (closure) year  
- **Description**: Collected from [Global Energy Monitor]([https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase](https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-plant-tracker/)). Useful for analyzing spatial patterns of energy infrastructure, coal retirement dynamics, renewable energy deployment, and environmental co-benefits.

### 2. China Steel Plant Data  
- **Coverage**: Mainland China  
- **Attributes**:  
  - Plant location (geocoded)  
  - Production capacity 
  - Ownership type (state-owned, private, joint venture)  
  - Commissioning and closure year  
  - Facility type (e.g., blast furnace, electric arc furnace)  
- **Description**: Enables tracking the evolution of China’s heavy industry, assessing spatial mismatches between production and pollution, and estimating plant-level emissions impacts.
